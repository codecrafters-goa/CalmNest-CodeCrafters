# CalmNest
Many people today feel stressed, anxious, or emotionally tired because of busy lifestyles. It's often hard for them to find helpâ€”either because of social pressure, high costs, or not knowing where to look. There needs to be an easy, friendly place online where people can find support and tools to feel better and take care of their mental health.
CalmNest is a friendly website that helps people feel better when they are stressed, sad, or tired. It offers relaxing music, fun videos, peaceful quotes, simple yoga exercises, and even a way to talk to someone if you need help.
Think of it as a quiet, cozy nest where your mind can rest and heal. Everything is in one place, so it's easy to use and helpful for anyone who wants to feel calm and happy again.
